    <div class="article__body-wrapper">
      <div class="article__txt-wrapper">
        <p>Five years ago, Jan Cramer noticed her property was rapidly disappearing.</p>
        <p>“When my son got married here, there was a rose garden out over where there’s air now,” she said, gesturing at the void on the edge of her lawn.</p>
        <p>Now, the slope has been pushed back more than 50 feet and drops down to the water at a near vertical angle.</p>
        <p>What caused this dramatic change, Cramer explained as she walked along the craggy lip of her property, was high lake levels.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years, lake levels have continued to climb driven by high rainfall. In August, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that Lake Michigan was more than 6 feet above its January 2013 level, tying a 33-year record. Lake Superior, according to the corps, reached its highest July average water level since recording began in 1918.</p>
        <p>North to south and east to west, this extended period of high water has pummeled Wisconsin’s coastal communities. Addressing the damage it has caused has exposed property owners to potentially staggering costs and left local governments with limited options.</p>
        <p>According to J. Elmo Rawling III, a researcher at the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey, when lake levels rise, waves remove more sediment from the base of the bluffs, causing them to steepen. Eventually, the angle becomes so steep that the cliff comes crashing down, carrying with it whatever sits on top, whether it be rose gardens and wedding memories or homes and roads.</p>
        <p>In Milwaukee County, sections of lakefront bluffs in Sheridan and Warnimont parks sloughed off earlier this year, according to Guy Smith, the executive director of the Parks Department.</p>
        <p>While only a few trees were carried along by these collapses, Smith worries that more serious damage could be done to department infrastructure, including buildings and pathways.</p>
        <p>Unstable bluffs are already a risk for park-goers and hikers, according to Daniel Mayer, chief of the Cudahy Fire Department. Between four and five times a year, the department is called out to rescue people who have been carried away or trapped after undercut sections have caved in. In addition to further eroding the slopes, the high water levels have submerged the beach in front of the bluffs making rescues even more difficult.</p>
        <p>“We get a whole gambit of injuries and rescue-type operations,” Mayer said, “from people just being unable to get back up, to people falling and being injured or even worse.”</p>
        <p>“We get a whole gambit of injuries and rescue-type operations,” Mayer said, “from people just being unable to get back up, to people falling and being injured or even worse.”</p>
        <p>He’s seen patches of water, murky with dissolved clay, extend more than 100 feet into the lake from the base of some of these worn away bluffs.</p>
        <p>“The high lake levels are just chewing everything up,” he said.</p>
        <p>In Ozaukee County, Andy Holschbach, director of the Land & Water Management department, received a call eight years ago from a resident who was concerned about the integrity of his bluff. In January, Holschbach heard back from the resident after disaster struck during a heavy rainstorm.</p>
        <p>“They’re watching TV, and all of the sudden they hear a big bang and they look and there’s 40, 50 feet of bluff let loose,” said Holschbach.</p>
        <p>The landowner invested in an expensive project to try to save his home, but in the end, had to sell his property.</p>
        <p>Stopping, or even slowing the march of erosion, has been a challenge for many communities.</p>
        <p>In 2014, around the time the Cramers noticed their backyard shrinking, Tony Beyer, the Mount Pleasant village engineer, started receiving complaints.</p>
        <p>“Properties out there were losing 10 to 20 to 30 feet a year,” he said.</p>
        <p>As the months went by, the bluffs kept creeping inland, wearing away backyards and undercutting patios. By 2016, 10 to 12 homes were in danger, according to then-Village President Gerald Garski. With landowners desperate to shore up their waterfronts, Racine County declared a state of emergency and turned to an unusual source of protective material.</p>
        <p>Around 1,600 cubic feet of concrete slabs were shuttled to the village from a torn-up runway at Waukegan National Airport. When they arrived, Julie Anderson, director of Racine County Public Works and Development Services, remembered people waiting in line with dump trucks and contractors.</p>
        <p>“Within a few days the material was completely spoken for,” Anderson said. “It didn’t even end up being a drop in the bucket.”</p>
        <p>To brainstorm longer-term solutions, public officials including Republican state Rep. Robin Vos and Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin converged on Mount Pleasant.</p>
        <p>The most urgent threat to public infrastructure was protecting two roads, which dead-ended at the bluff, and the utilities that went along with them. Engineering plans showed that just stabilizing the slopes directly in front of the dead-ends would not be enough; any piece-meal armoring of the shoreline would be undermined by the unprotected sections in between.</p>
        <p>Since the village would have to armor the entire 800-foot stretch between the two dead-end roads, a handful of landowners would have their bluffs stabilized.</p>
        <p>To build the large-scale revetment, or protective barrier, that would be needed, the village tried to partner with the Army Corps of Engineers. Beyer said the corps would have covered over half the cost of the project, but the plan never gained traction.</p>
        <p>According to Jim Luke, a project manager at the corps’ Detroit District, the Mount Pleasant project did not cover enough public infrastructure.</p>
        <p>“The investment the federal government is making has to have a positive benefit cost ratio,” he said. “For example, if the Corps of Engineers is investing $1 million in the project out there, they have to be saving at least $1 million worth of infrastructure. There were challenges there.”</p>
        <p>When it comes to dealing with bluff erosion, public officials often have limited financial options.</p>
        <p>To scramble the trucks and equipment needed to transport the concrete slabs from Waukegan National Airport to Mount Pleasant, Anderson said Racine County had to take $35,000 out of emergency funds, something local governments cannot do regularly.</p>
        <p>In Ashland County, where some landowners are rapidly losing land, the funds to deal with the issue simply are not available, according to Rowley.</p>
        <p>“There’s just no money to go around,” he said.</p>
        <p>In southeastern Wisconsin, a group of state and regional organizations has banded together to find lower-cost solutions as part of an initiative dubbed Coastal Actions for Resilience and Economic Security of Southeastern Wisconsin Bluff, Beach and Infrastructure assets.</p>
        <p>For the past two years, this program has been working to put local government officials in touch with scientists and specialists from UW-Madison, the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program, Wisconsin Sea Grant and the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.</p>
        <p>“Mount Pleasant was the canary in the coal mine,” said Adam Bechle, a coastal engineer and outreach specialist from Wisconsin Sea Grant. “We just started to make contact with every municipality and county in the (Southeastern Wisconsin) Regional Planning Commission region and develop a contact base.”</p>
        <p>By sharing experiences through this network and mapping shoreline recession rates, the group has developed a set of best practices that communities can use to manage their bluffs. County officials have been advised to implement stricter zoning ordinances requiring future homeowners to build further back from bluffs. Residents have been told to plant deep-rooted vegetation along their slopes and install drains to help anchor soil and redirect the flow of stormwater that would otherwise wash away sediment.</p>
        <p>Bechle admitted, however, that these solutions won’t work in all cases. When communities such as Mount Pleasant have lost large amounts of land, expensive revetments may be the only solution.</p>
        <p>In some instances, grants can help alleviate the financial strain. Gov. Tony Evers announced in March that $176,000 was being distributed to lakefront communities in southeastern Wisconsin by the Wisconsin Coastal Management Program. Out of that, the Milwaukee County Parks Department secured $19,000 to develop coastal management procedures for dealing with erosion.</p>
        <p>Smith, the parks director, said the department is also partnering with the Milwaukee County Environmental Services Division to inventory all of its assets at risk of being damaged by bluff failures. The intent is to save future costs by helping the Parks Department focus its efforts and attract more grants.</p>
        <p>“We would obviously have to prioritize our biggest needs,” said Smith. “Funding is a challenge for parks as well as for the county as a whole.”</p>
        <p>After being turned down by the Army Corps of Engineers, Mount Pleasant, however, did not have the time to search for alternative funding sources or plan for projects that would take years to develop.</p>
        <p>“These property owners are all standing there saying, ‘Well I don’t have three to five years,’” said Anderson.“‘ I’m going to lose my garage in the next storm if somebody doesn’t do something.’”</p>
        <p>Pressed for action, the village hired a private contractor in 2017 and invested $1.2 million into building its revetment.</p>
        <p>Andy Hartnell was one of the few lucky waterfront landowners whose property happened to lie along the stretch of shoreline Mount Pleasant was protecting. In 2016, he told the Journal Sentinel that he had brought in a crane to try to stabilize the slope on his own.</p><p>At the time, the bluff was tearing through his yard so quickly he had to take down his garage to keep from losing it to the lake.</p>
        <p>Three years later, he was looking out over the village’s completed revetment while sipping a soda and smoking a cigarette.</p>
        <p>Unlike the sheer cliff that bordered the Cramers’ property, the bluff behind Hartnell’s home sloped smoothly down to the water. Along the shore, armor stones weighing up to 6 tons held back the waves. While the dirt covering the bluff face was still as gray and dull as concrete, here and there the first hopeful tufts of grass were sprouting.</p>
        <p>According to Beyer, Mount Pleasant had to secure easements on the shorelines in front of every private property the revetment crossed. The village told Hartnell a maintenance team would have to come in every few years, but he was happy to have his bluff covered.</p>
        <p>“I went by in a plane a couple of weeks ago,” he said. “More people have the land falling apart than have it protected. I couldn’t believe it.”</p>
        <p>Cramer’s lot is a few hundred yards south of Hartnell’s. Since the public road running alongside her home turns private just before it dead-ends at the bluff, the village is not responsible for it.</p>
        <p>Some residents with unprotected waterfronts, like her neighbor, have been able to pay for armor stones like the ones used in the village project, but Cramer and her husband, who are now retired, simply cannot afford them.</p>
        <p>“We’re actually not doing anything,” she said. “It’s over $200,000 for us to shore up the hillside. And then about every five years, it’s another $20,000 to $40,000 just to maintain it.”</p>
        <p>The disparity between landowners who can afford revetments and those who cannot is magnified by the negative effect the structures can have on nearby unprotected shorelines.</p>
        <p>Cramer said that groundwater from her neighbor’s now armored property was being diverted onto her bluff, speeding up erosion.</p>
        <p>Large revetments can even block the lateral flow of sand along the shoreline keeping sediment that would otherwise help replenish unprotected bluffs from reaching them.</p>
        <p>In 2007, this happened on a dramatic scale when Concordia University Wisconsin in Mequon constructed a 2,700-foot-long protective wall along its lakefront. Property owners as far as a mile away from the barrier began reporting diminished or nonexistent shorelines. In 2011, two residents sued the university but were unsuccessful in winning damages in a trial three years later.</p>
        <p>Now that the lake levels have spiked, these residents are having an even harder time protecting their bluffs, according to Mike Kryshak, a Mequon waterfront landowner.</p>
        <p>“More and more people are putting (revetments) in to protect their homes,” he said.</p>
        <p>Kryshak was able to build a revetment two years ago, but since then, due to rising demand, the cost has significantly increased. While he paid under $1,000 per foot of protection, his neighbor, who is currently trying to shore up his bluff, just received a quote for around $1,400 a foot from the same contractor.</p>
        <p>“Some of these people have small cottages and are in their 80s and really can’t do anything about it,” said Kryshak. “They can’t afford to move and are on limited incomes. It’s just one of those situations.”</p>
        <p>This isn’t the first time Wisconsin waterfront communities have been seriously threatened by erosion. Every 30 years or so a combination of cold winters, which reduce evaporation, and heavy rainfall cause lake levels to spike, according to Rawling from the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey.</p>
        <p>While Anderson was doing research in the Racine County archives, she stumbled across the minutes of an old meeting that called for immediate action to save lakefront property in Mount Pleasant.</p>
        <p>“I turned that page open and I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t even believe I’m reading this,’” she said. “It’s almost like reading present day.’”</p>
        <p>The meeting was held in August 1918.</p>
        <p>For over 40 years, David Mickelson, a professor emeritus at UW-Madison’s Department of Geoscience, has watched Wisconsin’s interest in bluff erosion wax and wane with water levels. By using aerial photographs of the shoreline, he’s been able to measure how the mileage of protected bluffs has changed year to year.</p>
        <p>“Basically, when the water is low, people see white beaches and they quickly forget about any problems,” he said. “ When the water comes back for a couple years, then there’s lots of interest.”</p>
        <p>In the 1980s, lake levels reached records and landowners were just as desperate then as they are now.</p>
        <p>“We had 40 feet of beach a few years ago, 50 feet of yard, and a pier below the bluff,” Barbara Power, a Mount Pleasant resident, told The Journal in 1986. “All that is gone now. The garage is next, and the garage is only a couple of feet from my home.”</p>
        <p>Local governments also faced the same roadblocks to securing funding.</p>
        <p>“The Town of Pleasant Prairie has been turned down four times by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for federal help to protect 1st Ave,” the same 1986 Journal article reported. “The road does not qualify because no utilities are involved and it is not a major thoroughfare.”</p>
        <p>Recently, the continued threat of erosion along the Great Lakes has begun to receive national attention. In Congress, Baldwin plans to reintroduce her Waterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act. If passed, this bill would recognize lakefront communities that adopt a plan from the Department of Commerce to integrate economic, ecosystem and infrastructure challenges and opportunities to deal with erosion. The act will also establish a network for communities to share best practices and help attract new investments.</p>
        <p>Recently, the continued threat of erosion along the Great Lakes has begun to receive national attention.

If passed, this bill would recognize lakefront communities that adopt a plan from the Department of Commerce to integrate economic, ecosystem and infrastructure challenges and opportunities to deal with erosion. The act will also establish a network for communities to share best practices and help attract new investments.</p>
        <p>“Across Wisconsin, waterfront communities are a critical part of our economy, but in recent years coastal erosion has damaged our shores, threatening homeowners and waterfront economies,” Baldwin said in a statement. “That’s why I’m committed to making sure our waterfront communities have the resources and tools they need.”</p>
        <p>In April, Baldwin also partnered with U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) on the Digital Coast Act, an initiative that aims to help coastal communities deal with varying water levels and other waterfront hazards by providing the tools to decipher mapping data available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>The Army Corps of Engineers is currently undertaking the Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which could bring more collaborative investment into dealing with coastal issues such as erosion. In a news release, the corps announced the plan will be submitted for consideration of funding in its 2020 budget.</p>
        <p>For this current cycle of erosion, Mickelson said that if the lakes stay at record levels for too much longer even more damage could be done when the high bluffs of northern Ozaukee County begin to fail.</p>
        <p>In the next few months, storms and high winds could cause severe destruction, according to Roger G. Miller, president of Miller Engineers & Scientists, a firm that consults landowners on shoreline protection.</p>
        <p>“This autumn, we are going to see damage like people haven’t seen for 30 years,” Miller told the Journal Sentinel in early summer.</p>
        <p>As Cramer stood on the edge of her bluff reflecting on the weddings and beach days gone by, she recognized that dealing with erosion was a necessary compromise to living on the lake. The same unforgiving environment that was slowly reclaiming her land had inspired a love of nature in her children and given her years of happiness. For her, each morning she can wake up and look out over the water is a gift.</p>
        <p>“It is been a great, great joy to be here,” she said. “It gives me peace.”</p>
