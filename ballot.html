        <p>While the presidential election still hangs in the balance, Lincoln County officials completed tallying a record amount of local ballots in the early morning hours following Election Day.</p>
        <p>The ballot reader at the county courthouse fell silent by 4:30 a.m. on Nov. 4. In all, 11,682 Lincoln County residents cast their votes in this year’s general election. The figure represents 88.8 percent of active voters in the county.</p>
        <p>Voters in Montana’s first House of Representatives district returned incumbent Republican Steve Gunderson to Helena. Gunderson received 3,723 votes. His Democratic challenger, Marv Sather, came away with 1,517 votes. </p>
        <p>Sather said he came away from the race proud of having run a campaign centered around kindness and integrity. While he said he did not criticize their beliefs, Sather found that his campaign did not resonate with angry voters. </p>
        <p>“Did what I thought was right,” he said. “I have no bitterness.” </p>
        <p>Gunderson was not immediately available for comment on Nov. 4. </p>
        <p>Incumbent Republican State Rep. Neil Duram won the race for the House District 2 seat. 4,918 residents in the district cast their votes for Duram. Democratic challenger Lori Ramsez secured 1,241 votes.</p>
        <p>After the election, Duram said that it felt good to be returning to office with a Republican majority in the state Legislature. In the upcoming session, Duram said his highest priority would be reforming school bus safety law. </p>
        <p>Ramesz said she was pleased with the turnout she received citing support from Democrats and Republican swing voters. Going into the election, Ramesz said she didn’t expect to win but intended to put pressure on Duram to pass legislation that would benefit Lincoln County. </p>
        <p>“I learned a lot and I am proud of the campaign I ran,” she said.</p>
        <p>Ramesz said she was disheartened by the Republican sweep of the state. In addition to securing the state house, GOP candidates retained control of the state senate and secured races up and down the ballot. While she would not have liked to see a Democratic sweep in Montana either, Ramesz said she was concerned about the lack of political balance in state government.</p>
        <p>Lincoln County voters reelected Republican County Commissioner Mark Peck (D-1) and Republican District Court Clerk Tricia Brooks. Both candidates ran unopposed in their respective races. </p>
        <p>The Associated Press called Montana’s U.S. Senate race in favor of incumbent Republican Steve Daines. In Lincoln County, Daines secured 8,340 votes while Democratic challenger Gov. Steve Bullock trailed with 3,200 votes. </p>
        <p>Current Democratic Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney conceded the race for governor to Republican and U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte in the early hours of Nov. 4. </p>
        <p>“There is no doubt our priorities and our visions for Montana are different. But I wish you the best as you continue your journey in public service,” Cooney said in his concession.</p>
        <p>Gianforte took 8,133 votes in Lincoln County. Cooney trailed with 2,975 votes locally.</p>
        <p>Republican Matt Rosendale, current state auditor and commissioner of securities and insurance, won the race for Montana’s lone U.S. House of Representative seat, according to the Associated Press. </p>
        <p>Rosendale secured 8,434 Lincoln County votes. Democratic candidate Kathleen Williams garnered 3,085. </p>
        <p>Initiatives regarding the legalization and legal age of possession for marijuana were passed by Montana voters. Constitutional Initiative 118, which would allow the state to set a legal age for purchasing, consuming or possessing alcohol, received 54.9 percent of the vote in Lincoln County. Initiative 190, which would legalize the possession of marijuana received 55.7 percent of the vote in Lincoln County. </p>
        <p>Montana voters approved constitutional amendments to change signature requirements for initiative and constitutional amendments.</p>
        <p>A legislative referendum, which would remove local government authority to regulate the carrying of permitted concealed weapons, remained too close to call on Nov. 4 according to the Associated Press. With 96 percent of results reported, however, 50.7 percent of Montana voters supported the action. In Lincoln County, the referendum carried 58.8 percent of the vote. </p>
        <p>In the presidential race, President Donald Trump won 8,516 votes in Lincoln County. Former Vice President Joseph Biden took 2,812 votes locally.</p>
